# Reflection: Version Control in My Data Analytics Project

Using Git and GitHub helped me manage my data analytics workflow efficiently.
By creating separate scripts for preprocessing and analysis, I maintained clarity and organization throughout the project.

Each commit represented a clear step of progress, enabling reproducibility and version tracking.
Hosting my project on GitHub gave me a cloud backup and collaboration-ready workflow.
