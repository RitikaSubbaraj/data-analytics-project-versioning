# Reflection: Version Control in My Data Analytics Project

Using Git and GitHub helped me efficiently manage my analytics workflow.
I tracked every major update through commits, keeping preprocessing, analysis,
and notebook work well-documented. Each change is versioned, allowing me to
reproduce results and revert mistakes.
